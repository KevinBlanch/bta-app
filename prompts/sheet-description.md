# Developer Brief: Google Ads Data Integration for React Next.js App

## Data Source Overview
Your Next.js app will need to integrate with Google Sheets data generated by our Google Ads script. The sheet contains two tabs with the following structures:

## Tab 1: "SearchTerms"
This tab contains search term performance data:

| Header | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| search_term | string | The actual search query used |
| campaign | string | Campaign name |
| ad_group | string | Ad group name |
| impressions | number | Number of ad impressions |
| clicks | number | Number of clicks received |
| cost | number | Cost in account currency (already converted from micros) |
| conversions | number | Number of conversions |
| conversion_value | number | Total conversion value |
| cpc | number | Cost per click (calculated) |
| ctr | number | Click-through rate (decimal, not percentage) |
| conv_rate | number | Conversion rate (decimal, not percentage) |
| cpa | number | Cost per acquisition |
| roas | number | Return on ad spend (value/cost) |
| aov | number | Average order value (value/conversions) |

## Tab 2: "Daily"
This tab contains daily campaign performance data:

| Header | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| campaign | string | Campaign name |
| campaignId | string | Campaign ID (stored as string) |
| clicks | number | Number of clicks received |
| lostBudget | number | Budget lost impression share (decimal) |
| imprShare | number | Impression share (decimal) |
| lostRank | number | Rank lost impression share (decimal) |
| value | number | Conversion value |
| conv | number | Number of conversions |
| cost | number | Cost in account currency (already converted from micros) |
| impr | number | Number of impressions |
| date | string | Date in YYYY-MM-DD format |

## Implementation Notes

1. **Data Types**: Ensure proper type casting when fetching from Sheets API:
   - Parse numeric fields with `Number()` or `parseFloat()`
   - Handle all string fields with appropriate string methods
   - Date values come as strings in YYYY-MM-DD format and might need formatting for display

2. **Percentage Values**: Several metrics (CTR, conv_rate, imprShare, etc.) are stored as decimals (0.15 rather than 15%). Format these as percentages for display with 0 dec places.

3. **Currency Values**: Cost, conversion_value, cpc, cpa, etc. should be formatted according to the account's currency.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement checks for missing or null values, as some metrics might not be available for all campaigns/terms.

5. **Sorting and Filtering**: Plan for users wanting to sort and filter data by various dimensions and metrics.
